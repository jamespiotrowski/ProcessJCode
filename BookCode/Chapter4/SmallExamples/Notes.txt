    - says x.read() but x is an int

    - I think dr. pedersen made changes already but there are still issues:

    - Book version:
        - not sure ((x = c.read()) > 0) is a valid PJ expression
        - total = total + c (should say x)
    
    - ?new? version (in code Dr. Pedersen emailed me)
        - (x = > 0) // should be (x >= 0)

    - This code wont compile. Submitting as bug
        From Ben:
        "At the moment, you can't return values from a function/method that becomes a PJProcess. Dr. Pedersen and I talked about this in the past... and it stayed in the past he he :)"
